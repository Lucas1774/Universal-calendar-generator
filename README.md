THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY COMPILED BY A CUSTOM C++ SUBSET DEDICATED COMPILER.

## Program

This program is based on the [zeller's congruence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeller%27s_congruence). Its application is not trivial because of the months of January and February.  
Super cool program, and fun to make, except for the rendering.  
It Might or might not work for years before 1600 and after 3000, especially the former.
